				<p class="part_desc">
				The Arduino Due is a microcontroller board based on the Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU (datasheet). It is the first Arduino board based on a 32-bit ARM core microcontroller. It has 54 digital input/output pins (of which 12 can be used as PWM outputs), 12 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 84 MHz clock, an USB OTG capable connection, 2 DAC (digital to analog), 2 TWI, a power jack, an SPI header, a JTAG header, a reset button and an erase button.The board contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a micro-USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. The Due is compatible with all Arduino shields that work at 3.3V and are compliant with the 1.0 Arduino pinout.

	<h3>Raspberry Pi</h3>
			<div>
				<img class="part_img" alt="Raspberry" src="img_electronics_raspberrypi.jpg"/>
				<p class="part_desc">
				The Raspberry Pi is a single-board computer developed in the UK by the Raspberry Pi Foundation . The Raspberry Pi is a credit-card sized computer that plugs into your TV and a keyboard. It’s a capable little PC which can be used for many of the things that your desktop PC does, like spreadsheets, word-processing and games. It also plays high-definition video. The design is based around a Broadcom BCM2835 SoC, which includes an ARM1176JZF-S 700 MHz processor, VideoCore IV GPU, and 512 Megabytes of RAM. The design does not include a built-in hard disk or solid-state drive, instead relying on an SD card for booting and long-term storage. This board is intended to run Linux kernel based operating systems.

				<p class="part_desc">
				The Arduino duemilanove ATmega2560 is a low-power CMOS 8-bit
				microcontroller based on the AVR enhanced RISC architecture. By executing
				powerful instructions in a single clock cycle, the ATmega 2560achieves
				throughputs approaching 1 MIPS per MHz allowing the system designer to

  	<h3>Line Sensor</h3>
			<div>
				<img class="part_img" alt="Line Sensor" src="img_electronics_linesensor.png"/>
			
				<p class="part_desc">
				Line sensors are used for sensing white line on dark surface or black line on light
				surface. This line sensor board has seven line sensors connected together. These
				sensors working together can follow any curved or zigzag path. The multiple
				sensors can even detect nodes and move on the maze of white or black lines. Line
				sensor consists of high intensity red LED for illumination and directional photo
				transistor for line sensing. Phototransistor consists of a photo transistor and
				convex lens. Because of the precise alignment between lens and photo transistor
				it has a very narrow viewing angle of 5 degrees. This makes the line sensor highly
				immune to ambient light. This sensor gives 0.18 volts on bright surface and
				gives 2.2V or more on the dark surface. Its output is analog in nature. Because
				of analog output one can write complex algorithm to follow white line using
				microcontroller

				<img class="part_img" alt="H-Bridge" src="img_electronics_hbridge.png"/>			
				<p class="part_desc">
				An H-bridge is an electronic circuit which enables a voltage to be applied across
				a load in either direction. These circuits are often used in robotics and other
				applications to allow DC motors to run forwards and backwards

	<h3>PS3 Gamepad</h3>
			<div>
				<img  class="part_img" alt="PS3 Gamepad" src="img_electronics_ps3.png"/>
				<p class="part_desc">
				We used a PS3 remote to operate our Manual Robot. The manual robot was
				actually the same robot which was used to build the khafraa pyramid by burning a
				different program in the microcontroller. This different program made Arduino to
				read values from the PS3 gamepad. The PS3 was connected to the microcontroller
				with the help of an Arduino USB module.

	<h3>Arduino USB Module</h3>
			<div>
				<img  class="part_img" alt="USB Module" src="img_electronics_usbmodule.png"/>
				<p class="part_desc">
				The Arduino USB module makes Arduino Duemilanove capable of reading the
				Serial values sent via USB port from the PS3 remote. There is separate library to
				use this PS3 with the help of Arduino USB module. So, USB cable from the PS3
				is connected to this USB module which in turn connected to Arduino in which
				respective instructions can be given as per input from the PS3. This data from the
				PS3 is then processed in microcontroller to control the speed of the robot using
				Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). Pulse-width modulation (PWM) of a signal or 27
				power source involves the modulation of its duty cycle, to control the amount of power sent to the load.
				H-Bridges were used to drive the motor
