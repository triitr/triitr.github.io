			<h3>CONTEST THEME: Clean Energy Recharging the World</h3>
			
			<div>
				
				The game of ABU Robocon 2016 is designed in order to create the awareness of efficient energy consumption and clean and renewable energy utilization. Each team has to build two robots; Eco Robot and Hybrid Robot. Eco Robot doesn’t have an actuator to drive. It receives the driving energy from Hybrid Robot. Eco Robot has to use only one steering actuator to control its direction, to track the path containing Slopes and Hills, River, and Down Hill. Besides providing driving energy to Eco Robot, Hybrid Robot has to take Wind Turbine Propeller from Eco Robot and climb up Wind Turbine Pole in order to assemble Wind Turbine.
